        <h2>Our goal</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of the campaign is to make school lunch edible everywhere. 
            The standard of school food needs to go up, meeting the right nutritious value isn’t that hard but a lot of the time the food itself either doesn’t taste anything at all or tastes rather bad. 
            In some cases the food is barely even edible, ranging from rice that is harder than stone to pancakes that still have frost on them.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to SVT (2016), 4 out of 10 people dislike the food served in school. 
            While it’s not the majority, the number is still too high. 
            Keep in mind that this was asked in a school dining hall, there were likely many people who simply skipped lunch or ate elsewhere. 
            Therefore, we highly encourage everyone reading this to speak up about all the problems in case your school is in a similar situation.
