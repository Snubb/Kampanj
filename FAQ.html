            <i class="yellow">What about the schools who already have good food?</i><br>
            Our goal is to bring up the standard of school food across the country,
            schools that are already doing a good job should simply be an example of what other schools should aim to achieve.

            <i class="yellow">So what exactly can we do to help out?</i><br>
            Just spreading the word is the most simple yet effective way to help out.

            <i class="yellow">Why is this only in Sweden?</i><br>
            We are doing this campaign in Sweden specifically because that is where we live,
            however if you are experiencing similar things in other countries we highly encourage you to step up and make change yourself.
            Using this campaign as an example is also completely fine.
